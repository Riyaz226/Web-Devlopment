    of Kerala and then affiliated to University of Kerala, when it was formed in 1982. Mohamed Riyaz College is 
    situated in the central part of Tamil Nadu , Kerala city. It was established as a religious minority institution 
    with the primary objective of providing higher education to the downtrodden and socially backward section of the 
    society in general and Muslim minority in particular.<br/><br/>
    &#8658;The college is administered by the Society of Mohamed Riyaz College. It is established in a sprawling land

    <h3>Emblem & Motto:</h3>
    <p class="three">&#8658;The emblem of the college consists of a shield divided into four parts with a circle in 
    the middle. On the top left, there is a crescent and a star, a symbol of Islamic culture and faith in future 
    prosperity. On the right, there is an open book symbolizing knowledge. At the bottom right, there is a lotus, 
    the symbol for purity and prosperity. The bottom left represents a replica of Golden Rock standing for strength 
    and striving. Inset in the mid-circle is the frontage of the college main building with a dome and minarets 
    representing the essence of Islamic culture: The present is a preparation for the Hereafter. Underneath the 
    shield is a ribbon containing a verse from the Holy Quran in Arabic Script followed by its translation in 
    English that reads: 'Show us the right path', which is the motto of the college.<br/><br/> 
    &#8658;Thus the emblem of Kamal enshrines the ideals of cultural integration and guidance of learning and 
    striving to succeed in the Here and the Hereafter, tempered with constant prayers to the Almighty to guide us on 
    the straight path. The four figures in the shield are diagonally placed with green and yellow backgrounds, 
    stranding prosperity and happiness.</p>
