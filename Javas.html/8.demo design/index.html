    <h1>Functions In JavaScript</h1>  
<div class="first">
    <div class="first0">Call Method</div>
    <div class="first1"><q>Call() Method is a predefined  JavasScript Method.</q> Can be used tos invoke(call) a method with an owner object as an arugument(parmeter).<br/><br/>*with call(),an object can use a method  call, an object can use a method belonging to another object.</div>
    <div class="first2"><a href="call method.html">Explain</a></div>
</div>

<div class="second">
     <div class="second1">Apply Method</div>
     <div class="second2"><q>The apply() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array</q>.<br/><br/>*The apply() method is similar to the call() method excepts that it accepts the arguments of the function as an array instead of individual arguments.</div>
     <div class="second3"><a href="Apply method.html">Explain</a></div>  
</div>


<div class="third">
  <div class="third1">Bind Method</div>
  <div class="third2"><q>The bind() method creates a new function,when invoked, has the this sets to a provided value.</q><br/><br/>*The bind() method allows an object to borrow a method from another object without making acopy of that method.This is known as function borrowing in JavasScript.</div>  
  <div class="third3"><a href="Bind Method.html">Explain</a></div>  
</div>

 <div class="four">
   <div class="four1">IIFE</div>
    <div class="four2"><q>An Immediately-Invoked Function Experssion(IIFE for friends)</q>is a way to execute Functions immediately,as soon as they are created.<br/><br/>*IIFEs are very useful because they don't pollute the global object,and they are a simple way to isolate variables declarations.</div>
    <div class="four3"><a href="IIFE.html">Explain</a></div>  
  </div>

  <div class="five">
      <div class="five1">Closure</div>
      <div class="five2"><q>The reason is that functions in JavasScript from closures.</q>A Closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.</div>
      <div class="five3"><a href="Closure.html">Explain</a></div>

   <h1>Operators/Optional Chaining</h1>
  <div class="six">
      <div class="six1">Spread:</div>
      <div class="six2">*Spread Syntax(...)allows ann iterable such as an array experssion or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls)or elements(for array literals)are expected,or an object experssion to be expanded in places where zero or more key value paris(for object literals)are expected. </div>          
      <div class="six3">Spread Operator:</div>
      <div class="six4">*The spread operator is a new addition to the set of operators in JavasScript ES6.It takes in an iterable(e.g an array)and expands it into individual elements.The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS objects.Using this operator makes the code concise and enhances its readability. </div>
      <div class="six5"><a href="Spread.html">Explain</a></div>
  </div>

   <div class="seven">
       <div class="seven1">Rest Operator:</div>
       <div class="seven2">*The reat operator(...) allows us to call a function with any number of aruguments and then access those excess  arguments as an array.<br/><br/>*The rest operator also allows us in destructuring array or objects.<br/><br/>*The spread operator(...)allows us to expand an iterable like array into its individual elements.<br/><br/> </div>
       <div class="seven3">TypeScript:</div>
       <div class="seven4">*TypeScript introduced rest parameters to accommodate number of parameters that a function will receive is not known or can vary,we can use rest parameters.In JavaScript,this is achieved with the "arguments" variable. </div>
       <div class="seven5"><a href="Rest Operator.html">Explain</a></div>
   </div>

   <div class="eight">
    <div class="eight1">Optional Chaining:</div>
    <div class="eight2">*The optional chaining operator provides a way to simplify accessing values through connected objects when it's possible that a reference or function may be undefined or null.For example,consider an object obj which has a nested struture.<br/><br/>*JavasScript Optional Chaining is definitely an addition to look forward to and forward to and has very good use cases,but if used carelessly,it willdo more damage than good.<br/><br/>*Optional  chaining,as a part of ES2020,changes the way properties are accessed from deep object structures.</div>
